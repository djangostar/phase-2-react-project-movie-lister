# Getting Started with Movie Lister App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality

I consider this project simple yet clean and straight to the point. You can add movies to your list by entering the required fields in the the 'Add Movie' Link in the Navigation bar(component). You can click on each given title on the movie list component and it will redirect you to said movie's details, from there you can delete the movie if you no longer want it in your list. You can also go to About page which is just a little extra info on the languages used and special thanks to those who have helped me along the way.


### `Movies List`
First thing is first, move the cursor over to the top NavBar, and the color of each link will change wether active or not. Once you click on 'Movies' You can see your list of movies which will persist due to updating state as added.

### `Movie Details`
Once in the Movies page, you can click on any movie you added and it will redirect you to said movie details(Title, Director, ImgUrl and Synopsis) from there, You can delete the movie if so desired and it will redirect you to Movies, with the list updated as it's also updated in State, so it will persist.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
