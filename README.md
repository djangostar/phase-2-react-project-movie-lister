# Getting Started with Movie Lister App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Functionality
I consider this project simple yet clean and straight to the point. You can add movies to your list by entering the required fields in the the 'Add Movie' Link in the Navigation bar(component). You can click on each given title on the movie list component and it will redirect you to said movie's details, from there you can delete the movie if you no longer want it in your list. You can also go to About page which is just a little extra info on the languages used and special thanks to those who have helped me along the way.


### `Movies List`
First thing is first, move the cursor over to the top NavBar, and the color of each link will change wether active or not. Once you click on 'Movies' You can see your list of movies which will persist due to updating state as added.

### `Movie Details`
Once in the Movies page, you can click on any movie you added and it will redirect you to said movie details(Title, Director, ImgUrl and Synopsis) from there, You can delete the movie if so desired and it will redirect you to Movies, with the list updated as it's also updated in State, so it will persist.

### `Add a Movie`
Navigate over to Add Movie in the NavBar and it will take you to a page with a form submit where you can enter the information of the movie you want to add. Once added, it will redirect you back to your movies list where you can click on the title and see said movie details.
